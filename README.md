# Etubank

Etubank is a secure banking application designed to help small financial institutions manage customer accounts, process transactions, and handle loans. It provides an efficient platform for users to perform day-to-day banking activities, including:

- **Customer Management**: Manage customer profiles and account details.
- **Transaction Management**: Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- **Loan Management**: Apply for and manage loans.

The database will include at least 8 tables (Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Loans, etc.) with 6 foreign keys and 35 attributes. We will implement **time series data** to track transaction histories and **JSON** to store customer preferences, improving data analysis and user experience.

We will use a visual tool like **draw.io** to model the database schema and optimize it with **indices** to ensure fast query performance. The system will be tested under constrained resources (e.g., limited memory) to demonstrate performance improvements.

A **web interface** will allow:
- **Customers** to manage their accounts, transfer funds, and apply for loans.
- **Employees** to process transactions, manage accounts, and handle loans.

The project will follow a structured timeline with regular feedback to refine and optimize our solution.
